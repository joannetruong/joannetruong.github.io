            <p class="descrip"><b>TLDR: </b>I conducted research at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) on the Magnetorheological (MR) damper location optimization for the mitigation of structural damage due to high-impact loads. MR dampers are smart control devices that can change from a free-flowing state to a semi-solid state in the presence of a magnetic field. I conducted impact drop tests to find the opimal location of these dampers on a bridge stucture. I collected displacement and acceleration data from my tests, and wrote MATLAB scripts to analyze the log files. I graphed the structural response reduction due to dampers to compare the effectiveness of the different combinations of dampers. I also wrote a research paper to be used as a foundation for journal publication, and I created a poster of my work to present to professors and graduate students.

            <p class="descrip"><b>Full Story: </b>About a year after our debut with PickyHusky, our team decided to tackle HackMIT. Last time, our hack was purely software. However, since our group was comprised of two computer scientists and two electrical engineers (including myself), the electrical engineers decided to revolt and demanded a hack that included hardware this time. Luckily for us, there was a lot of hardware at the hackathon for us to borrow. Although we had no previous experience with Internet of Things (IoT), we decided that using the Particle Photon for IoT implementation would be a good way for us to merge hardware with software.</p>
