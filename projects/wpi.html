MR dampers are smart control devices that utilize fluids that can change from a free-flowing state to a semi-solid state in the presence of a magnetic field. I conducted impact drop tests to find the opimal location of these dampers on a bridge stucture. I collected displacement and acceleration data from my tests, and wrote MATLAB scripts to analyze the log files. I graphed the structural response reduction due to dampers to compare the effectiveness of the different combinations of dampers. I also wrote a research paper to be used as a foundation for journal publication, and I created a poster of my work to present to professors and graduate students.

            <p class="descrip"><b>Full Story: </b>Just before the semester of my first year at Northeastern University ended, I applied for a couple research positions at various universities. I was accepted to the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) at Worcester Polytechnic Institude (WPI). REUs are NSF funded research opportunities for undergraduates and I was excited to get some exposure to engineering research. The research project I worked on was the "Magnetorheological (MR) damper location optimization for the mitigation of structural damage due to high-impact loads". I know. It's a mouthful. 
            <br><br> 
            When explaining what the research entails, it's important to first take a step back and explain the problem we're trying to solve first. Bridges. Bridges are vital components of our infrastructure, and serve us in connecting us from place to place. One of the most prevalent causes of bridge collapses is due to collision, mainly from high impact loads. This means ships or vessels crashing into the bridge, causing structural damage, or collapse. We wanted to develop a radar based smart control system to detect the incoming collision, and mitigate the damage from the impact onto the bridge structure.</p>

                <p class="descrip">The proposed RSCS uses a radarbased force identification system to predict imminent impact loads, MR dampers to dissipate the impact energy, and an effective feedforward control system for system control. It will plan for pre-impact structural control by stifening the MR dampers. After the initial impact, feedback controllers will measure the structural response, and an adaptive controller will adjust the stiffness of MR dampers to mitigate damage on the bridge structure.  </p>

            <p class="descrip">In order to effectively mitigate damage, the location of the MR dampers must be optimized to reduce structural displacement and/or accelerations. The location optimization was the focus of my research. </p>
            <p class="descrip">Having explained this much of my project, one big question still remains. <b> What the hell are magnetorheological (MR) dampers? </b> MR dampers are semi-active control devices that utilize controllable fluids. In this case, magnetorheological fluids. MR fluids are composed of 20-40% of pure, soft iron particles that are suspended in a carrier fluid such as mineral oil or synthetic oil. The fluid can change from a free-flowing state to a semi-solid state in the presence of a magnetic field. This semi-active control device employs the flexibility of active control devices and the stability of passive control devices without the use of large power sources, making it the optimal choice for our system. </p>
