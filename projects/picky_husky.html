            <p class="descrip">TLDR: First hackathon. My team and I used Ruby on Rails (nokogiri, devise, clockwork) and Twilo to create a web application for sending out notifications when foods are avaliable in the dining hall. The user would be able to select the foods they want to be notified of from our list of thousands of foods (scrapped off Northeastern dining website). They would then receive a text message listing the type of food avaliable, which dining hall it's offered in, and what meal they can get it for (breakfast, lunch or dinner).</p>
            <p class = "descrip"> ___________________________________________________________________________</p>
            <p class="descrip">Full Story: At my first ever hackathon, I attemped to apply my front-end web development skills that I learned from working on this very own website. My friends and I decided to create a web app to tackle a harrowing problem university students face on a daily basis: will chicken tenders be offered in the dining hall today? </p>
            <br>
            <p class="descrip">Ok, it doesn't necessarily have to be chicken tenders, but we wanted to create an app that would send a text message notification to alert the user when their favorite foods are avaliable in the dining hall. Meal plans at Northeastern University give the student a certain number of meal swipes per week (ex: 10, 15, 19 swipes), depending on how much you paid. For those with smaller meal plans, it's important to use your swipes wisely, perhaps only when you know your favorite meal would be served that day. That's when our app comes in handy!</p>

        <p class="descrip">Our app was built using Ruby on Rails, specifically nokogiri for webscraping 85 days worth of foods from the Northeastern dining halls, devise for user authentification, clockwork for job scheduling, and Twilio for text messaging. As displayed in our signup page above, we weren't willing to pay for Twilio, so currently our web app only works with the phone number we registered (my phone is the only one with the power!!)</p>

The user can even search by rarity, so they can receive notifications when foods such as lobster are avaliable in the dining hall! </p>
