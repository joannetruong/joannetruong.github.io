            <p class="descrip"><b>TLDR: </b>My team and I created a cross platform mobile app using NativeScript (who happened to be one of the sposors of HackMIT). The app would help people pair up in a tinder style "swiping" way for everyday activities such as buying groceries or exercising. We also connected a particle photon to our ruby on rails backend to allow users to make posts with the click of a button (think amazon dash button but for posting on our app). Our app ended up winning the award for "Best NativeScript App for IoT"!</p>

            <p class="descrip"><b>Full Story: </b>About a year after our debut with PickyHusky, our team decided to tackle HackMIT. Last time, our hack was purely software. However, since our group was comprised of two computer scientists and two electrical engineers (including myself), the electrical engineers decided to revolt and demanded a hack that included hardware this time. Luckily for us, there was a lot of hardware at the hackathon for us to borrow. Although we had no previous experience with Internet of Things (IoT), we decided that using the Particle Photon for IoT implementation would be a good way for us to merge hardware with software.</p>

        <div class="col-md-5">
            <p class="descrip">For a long time, we struggled. With hundreds of students connected, the wifi at MIT was spotty at best for the first 7 hours of the hack. This was especially crippling becuase the main part of the hardware hack was connecting the particle photon to the wifi. <i> Finally</i> after hours of tinkering, we were able to send a GET to our Ruby on Rails back end which would trigger a our "button press" controller, making a post for the user. The hardware side had a bit more time, so we threw on a speaker to output a "meow" sound when the button was pressed using pulse code modulation (PCM). We also 3D printed a case shaped like pusheen to house all our hardware. Since pusheen is such a versatile cartoon cat with many personas, it would be easy (and adorable) to create many pusheens for different activities such as grocery pusheen or exercise pusheen.

                </div>

            <p class="descrip">And the result is...</p>
            <p class="descrip">Despite the many internet issues that almost made us pack up and go home, our team pushed through and kept spirits high throughout the night (the therapy dogs that showed up in the middle of the hackathon helped too). We ended up winning the "Best NativeScript App for IoT" award, so our team went home proud and an Amazon gift card richer.</p>
