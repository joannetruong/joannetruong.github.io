Currently, the Celljet is controlled using G-Code, and has built in software, but the software does not allow for easy user input and generation of 3D models. Improvements that will allow the software to easily convert 3D CAD models to discrete printable points that the CellJet will then use to print biologic material layer by layer is necessary, and was my main focus of the project. The objectives for this project were broken down into different milestones. The first milestone is the creation of a procedure to convert basic 3D structure to discrete, printable points that can be integrated with the current program. The next stage of this project will be integrating the software into the cell jet with common G-code software available. The last milestone of the project is the creation of a software package that integrates 3D modeling and accommodates for biological printing of live cells. We expect to be able to build software that is compatible with the software from Digilab that allows the user to easily build a 3D biological model using live cells.</p>

            <p class="descrip"><b>Full Story: </b>About a year after our debut with PickyHusky, our team decided to tackle HackMIT. Last time, our hack was purely software. However, since our group was comprised of two computer scientists and two electrical engineers (including myself), the electrical engineers decided to revolt and demanded a hack that included hardware this time. Luckily for us, there was a lot of hardware at the hackathon for us to borrow. Although we had no previous experience with Internet of Things (IoT), we decided that using the Particle Photon for IoT implementation would be a good way for us to merge hardware with software.</p>
